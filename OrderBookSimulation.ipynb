What I did in this extra credit:


*   I rewrote the methods to run together in a way that allows a collection of order queues at different prices
*   Market orders will take from the min or max of the asks or bids
*   I changed the initialize_limit_order_book method to create an order book of prices and quantities based on a normal distribution
*   i changed the update limit order method to also take in a price parameter to know which price in the nested dictionary to update
*   The simulation can be run with different variables to create deeper or more dispersed order books as well. The simulation also simulates a number of new orders coming in, and reports how liquidity changed from them



#in this version of the method I just wanted to simulate some other queues at different prices.

The main issue with my simulator, which you can run below, is that it can only run a limited amount of times. Which is why I divide the number of simulations by 1,000. 

The reason for this is that the way order_flow logic works now, is that if there are more buyers in the liquidity pool, the order flow method will only add new buy orders, eventually buying out all of the seller. 

Either this could be fixed by taking into account the imbalance of liquidity when deciding if a new order is a buyer or seller, or making the status of buyer or seller completely random as well.
